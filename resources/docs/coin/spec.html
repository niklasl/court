      Composition of Identifier Names (CoIN) is a vocabulary and method for
      describing how URIs for resources are composed from data about them.
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
      The CoIN vocabulary defines a set of classes and properties used to
      describe what properties of a resource constitute components of a URI.
      (Who for all other purposes are supposed to be treated as opaque.)
      </p>
      <p>
      Data described using CoIN can thus be used to control how to mint and/or
      check such URIs.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <p>
        This document is one of the two core documents of CoIN. The other is the
        <strong><a href="http://purl.org/court/def/2009/coin#">CoIN vocabulary
            definition</a></strong> <a href="#ref-COIN-VOC">[COIN-VOC]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        This document is aimed at both data publishers (those involved in
        hosting and maintaining data), and data users (those involved in
        finding, querying, crawling and indexing data).
        </p>
        <p>
        Readers of this document should be familiar with the core concepts of
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-primer-20040210/">RDF</a> [[RDF-PRIMER]]
        and
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-schema-20040210/">RDF Schema</a> [[RDF-SCHEMA]].
        Knowledge of the
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/turtle/">Turtle syntax</a> [[TURTLE]]
        for RDF is required to read the examples. Some knowledge of widely-used vocabularies
        (<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/2010/10/11/dcmi-terms/">Dublin Core Terms</a> [<a href="#ref-DC-TERMS">DC-TERMS</a>],
        <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/20100809.html">Friend of a Friend</a> [[FOAF]])
        is also assumed.

        <p>
        All examples in this document are written in the
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/turtle/">Turtle RDF syntax</a>
        [[TURTLE]]. Throughout the document, the following namespaces are used:

        <h3>Definitions</h3>
        <dl>
        <dt>URI Space</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
            A URI space defines one specific approach for coining a URI.
            Commonly one space is defined for a specific domain (or
            subdomain/-segment thereof). While there can be many such
            approaches, and thus several URI spaces describing the same
            "resource space", it is recommended to define one canonical space.
            Make it as durable as possible (in terms of identity and time), and
            stick with it.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Template</dt>
          <dd>
          ...
          </dd>
          <dt>Variable</dt>
          <dd>
          A variable within a URI template defines a hypothetical, logically
          constrained value space local to some specific domain context. Care
          must be taken to ensure unique values within a variable value space,
          since collisions will break the uniqueness requirement.
          </dd>
          <dt>Slug</dt>
          <dd>
          A slug is one or more URI segments used to represent an opaque
          reference for a resource, unique within a specific value space.
          </dd>
        </dl>

    <section>
      <h2>Concept</h2>
      <p>
      With CoIN you describe spaces of templates for URI construction. These
      spaces use <a
        href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gregorio-uritemplate-04">URI
        templates</a> <a href="#ref-URITEMPLATES">[URITEMPLATES]</a> to
      describe the composition structure. URI Templates contain variables,
      which are mapped to values by declaring a link between a variable and a
      property of the resource.
      </p>

        <h3>Principles of URI Design</h3>
        <p>URI design principles have evolved...</p>
        <p>... contextually unique and durable over time.</p>
        <p>... akin to "composite keys" in relational databases, but with support for slugs from related descriptions.</p>

      <h2>Method</h2>
      <p>
      URIs are coined for a resource by reading the space and trying to match
      a full path (greediest match "wins"). This includes matching by type, or
      computing tokens for property values, either directly, from the property
      value of a reference, or by finding a "slug token" for the referenced
      resource (in a given dataset).
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
        <i>This is an outline of how an algorithm for minting URIs using CoIN should work.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
        A URI can minted for a resource by using a <tt>coin:URISpace</tt>. A space
        defines a set of Templates (via <tt>coin:template</tt>). They are defined as
        the combination of a <tt>coin:uriTemplate</tt> (based on the syntax of the URI
        template draft), and variable <tt>coin:binding</tt> definitions.
        </p>
        <p>
        Each variable of a template defines a property (<tt>coin:property</tt>) for
        which a value will be used to fill in a variable in the URI template. The
        variable name is either given explicitly (using
        <tt>coin:variable</tt>), or by using the leaf part of the URI of the
        property <i>(N.B.: this "leaf" usage should be considered
        experimental)</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
        If there is a value for <strong>all</strong> of the components, the template
        "matches" and a URI can be constructed by using the URI template and
        the values for the variables.
        </p>
        <p>
        A space can also define a base (<tt>coin:base</tt>) to be used for
        constructing the URI (thus the URI templates need not be full URIs, only
        absolute).
        </p>
        <p>
        Furthermore, templates can narrow the match by defining which type the resource
        must have for the template to match (using <tt>coin:forType</tt>).
        </p>
        <p>
        The value is expected to be a literal (of any type), unless the variable
        defines a second property (using <tt>coin:slugFrom</tt>). If present, the value
        to use is the value for a related resource (related via the object of the
        variable's <tt>coin:property</tt>). In SPARQL:
        </p>
        <pre class="example">
        ?binding
            coin:property ?property;
            coin:slugFrom ?slugFrom .
        ?resource ?property ?related .
        ?related ?slugFrom ?value .
        </pre>
        <p>
        There is also a way to define how to mint fragment URIs by appending resolved
        fragment templates to a base URI picked from a relation from or to the
        resource. <i>has yet to be documented.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
        Finally, CoIN defines properties for describing how values must be translated
        before the URI is constructed (using <tt>coin:slugTranslation</tt> with e.g.
        type(s) <tt>coin:LowerCasedTranslation</tt>, <tt>coin:BaseCharTranslation</tt>,
        optionally defining a specific <tt>coin:spaceReplacement</tt> and/or
        matching/stripping using regexps). Once completed, remaining characters illegal
        in URI segments must be URI encoded (unless a complete base is presevered by
        prepending them with &quot;+&quot;, according to the URI Templates draft).
